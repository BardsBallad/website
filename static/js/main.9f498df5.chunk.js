Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself.\nIn the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally.

In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\nKing of diamonds - Sun - You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\nQueen of diamonds - Moon - You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.\nJack of diamonds - Star - Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\nTwo of diamonds - Comet* - If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\nAce of hearts - The Fates* - Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\nKing of hearts - Throne - You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\nQueen of hearts - Key - A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\nJack of hearts - Knight - You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\nTwo of hearts - Gem* - Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\nAce of clubs - Talons* - Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\nKing of clubs - The Void - This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\nQueen of clubs - Flames - A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\nJack of clubs - Skull - You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\nTwo of clubs - Idiot* - Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4+1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\nAce of spades - Donjon* - You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\nKing of spades - Ruin - All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\nQueen of spades - Euryale - The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\nJack of spades - Rogue - A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\nTwo of spades - Balance* - Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\nJoker (with TM) - Fool* - You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\nJoker (without TM) - Jester - You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards",types:["wondrous"],sources:[{source:"DMG",page:162}]},{id:"ndtyowtcnksmoozcmzgjgofg",name:"Demon Armor",category:"HA",rarity:"Very Rare",desc:"While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal.

The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.\n**Random Properties**: An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties:\n- 2 minor beneficial properties\n- 1 minor detrimental property\n- 1 major detrimental property\n**Spells**: The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\n**Call Dragons**: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n**Destroying an Orb**: An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",types:["wondrous"],reqAttune:!0,charges:7,sources:[{source:"DMG",page:225}]},{id:"aczbbcxhshvcvcaxsoezbbvq",name:"Ox",category:"TG",rarity:"None",desc:"",value:"15 gp",sources:[{source:"PHB",page:157}]},{id:"stvelndzxejqpmvqcbknnfja",name:"Painter's Supplies",category:"AT",rarity:"None",desc:"Proficiency with painter's supplies represents your ability to paint and draw.

The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.",types:["wondrous"],sources:[{source:"DMG",page:160}]},{id:"bgyavjnuvkcjxrooyxtdfmqc",name:"Handy Haversack",rarity:"Rare",desc:"This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",types:["wondrous"],weight:"5",sources:[{source:"DMG",page:174}]},{id:"txdsdhylrpqivctleaqwbmav",name:"Iron Bands Of Binding",rarity:"Rare",desc:"This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound.

As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.\nMake a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.\nA creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.\nOnce the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.",types:["wondrous"],weight:"1",sources:[{source:"DMG",page:177}]},{id:"xwrqqocettwxbescfobalvrq",name:"Restorative Ointment",rarity:"Uncommon",desc:"This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4+1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe.

The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features\u2014such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons\u2014that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.",types:["wondrous"],weight:"1",sources:[{source:"DMG",page:183}]},{id:"qfchceaqbfowhrvnvlacpaqe",name:"Efficient Quiver",rarity:"Uncommon",desc:"Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds.
